            trawberries are sweet supple red fruits with surfaces that are seed-studded. 
            They come from a low-growing plant belonging to genus (Fragaria) of 
            the rose (Rosaceae) family, enclosing white flowers, lobed foliage,
            and runners. They originate all through the north temperate zones.</p>
        <p>
            They are the most famous and trendiest fruits in the planet (Roger). 
            There are over 600 assortments of strawberries that vary in taste, size,
            and feel; all of which have similar trait: heart silhouette, red fleshy 
            tissue with yellow seeds shooting the surface, petite, royal leafy green lids, 
            and stalk that embellish their crowns (WHFoods). Below is picture of the strawberry fruit.</p>
        
        <h2 id="detailed-history">Detailed history</h2>
        <p>
            The word strawberry is coined from 'strewn' berries about the plants 
            and thus the 'strewn berry' finally turned into 'Strawberry' (Roger). 
            They are not actual fruits or berries but distended ends of the stamen 
            of the plant. The seeds are on the external surface, rather than the internal 
            berry. There are around 200 seeds for each berry. They are low in calories and 
            are non-fat, loaded with vitamin C, folic acid, fiber, vitamin B6 and potassium 
            (Roger).</p>
        <p>
            Over the years they have been utilized as medications for ailments like, stained 
            teeth, sunburns, gouts and digestion (Hopley, 9). Strawberries were served up at 
            medieval state occasions as a show of peace, wealth, and excellence. The most 
            well-known communal intake of strawberries is at the annual Wimbledon, when 
            strawberries and cream are often by very old venerated Englishmen in the middle 
            of tennis games (Hopley, 9).</p>
        
        <h2 id="various-uses">Various uses of strawberries</h2>
        <p>
            Strawberries have numerous uses. One of the most famous uses of 
            strawberries is being used as recipe or an ingredient in preparation of drinks, 
            meals or snacks. Strawberries are used as ingredients in many types of 
            foods like cakes, yoghurts, desserts, salads, juices, meals and 
            chocolates.</p>
